MapEscape
=========

A jQuery / Zepto plugin for maps.

This plugin detects if the viewable area on your map is greater than or beyond the screen height, and places a scrollable area to the right of your map. 
This scrollable area then allows you to scroll out of the map and reach the rest of the content on your web page.

1. Simple to integrate with one line of code.
2. Completely customisable via options, and CSS
3. Less than 1k minified
4. Compatable with both jQuery and Zepto

IMPLEMENTATION

$('.map').mapescape();
